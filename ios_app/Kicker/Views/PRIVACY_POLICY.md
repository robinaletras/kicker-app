# Privacy Policy for Kicker

**Last Updated: January 21, 2026**

## Overview

Kicker ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our card game app handles information.

## Information We Collect

Kicker operates entirely offline and does NOT collect, transmit, or share any personal information with external servers or third parties.

### Data Stored Locally

The following information is stored locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults:
- **Player Name**: The name you enter when first launching the app
- **Game Progress**: Your career mode progress, coin balance, and game history
- **Bank Loans**: Information about borrowed coins and repayment status
- **In-App Purchase Status**: Records of coins purchased (managed by Apple's StoreKit)

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to any server
- Is not shared with any third party
- Is not accessible to us or anyone else
- Is deleted when you uninstall the app

## In-App Purchases

Kicker uses Apple's StoreKit framework for in-app purchases of game coins. When you make a purchase:
- The transaction is processed entirely by Apple
- We do not collect or store your payment information
- Apple's Privacy Policy applies to payment processing
- Transaction records are maintained by Apple in your Apple ID account

## Data Usage

All data stored locally is used solely to:
- Save your game progress
- Display your career history
- Maintain your coin balance
- Track your player profile

## Third-Party Services

Kicker does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app operates completely offline.

## Children's Privacy

Kicker does not knowingly collect any information from children. Since all data is stored locally and never transmitted, there is no risk of inadvertent data collection from users of any age.

Parents should note that the game involves simulated gambling (betting with virtual coins) and is rated accordingly.

## Data Security

Your data is secured by:
- iOS system-level security
- Device encryption (if enabled on your device)
- No network transmission means no interception risk

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- **Delete Data**: Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data
- **Start Fresh**: Deleting and reinstalling creates a new profile
- **No Account**: No account means no server-side data to manage

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Apple's Privacy Requirements

In compliance with Apple's App Privacy Details:
- **Data Not Collected**: We do not collect any data
- **Data Not Linked to You**: No data is linked to your identity
- **Data Not Tracked**: We do not track you across other apps or websites
